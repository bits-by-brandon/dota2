                <h1>Rune Spawn</h1>
                <p>Runes are special items you can obtain that vanish when picked up, and give you a powerful effect for a short time. There are 5 types of runes: illusion, regeneration, double damage, haste and invisibilty. The rune will spawn randomly at one of two designated locations in the river (top or “bot” rune)

                <h1>Ancient Spawn</h1>
                <p>Ancient creeps are very powerful creeps, often with high HP and spell immunity. Their danger is made up for in rewards, if a Hero can survive long enough to reap them. They give anywhere between 215-346 gold and 279-393 experience.

An average Ancient creep camp yields 264 gold and 355 experience. </p>

                <h1>Neutral Creep</h1>
                <p>Neutral Creeps are tougher, more dangerous creeps that appear in the forest. They are aligned to neither of the teams, and offer an alternative source of Gold and Experience. Heroes can focus on killing Neutral creeps in order to farm, by Jungling. Some Neutral creeps also have special abilities. Heroes such as Doom can make use of these abilities, and turn them against their enemies. Roshan is also considered a Neutral creep. </p>

                <h1>Roshan Pit</h1>
                <p>Roshan, sometimes also referred to as Roshan the Immortal, is the most powerful neutral creep in Dota 2. It easily outmatches most heroes in one vs one combat. A team generally waits until later in the game where the damage dealers have better items, or tries to take it on with the entire team. Every 4 minutes (starting at first lane creep spawn) Roshan gets stronger, gaining 20 extra Slam damage, +500 hp, +10 damage and +0.5 armor (given by an aura). </p>

                <h1>Rune Ward Spot</h1>
                <p>Absolutely essential to victory, Observer Wards allow you to keep watch over areas and spy on your enemies while keeping you and other heroes safe. It is important to keep wards up in key locations, and destroy enemy wards. Placing a ward here helps keep the spawning runes under control.</p>

                <h1>Secret Shop</h1>
                <p>The Secret Shops are located near the center of the map. One Secret Shop is in the forests between the top and middle lanes, on the Radiant side. The other is in the forests between the bottom and middle lanes, on the Dire side. Heroes may use either Secret Shop, regardless of their team. The Secret Shop can be used by the Animal Courier, or by players if their team's courier is near the Secret Shop.</p>

                <h1>Tower</h1>
                <p>Each faction's three lanes are guarded by 3 Towers, and their Ancient guarded by 2 neighboring Towers. Towers become higher tier depending on how far they are in a lane. Every Tower, except for Tier 1 Towers, is invulnerable until the Tower preceeding it is destroyed. The two Towers defending a team's Ancient become vulnerable if any Tier 3 Tower is destroyed.  </p>

                <h1>Barracks</h1>
                <p>Barracks are special buildings, defended by Tier 3 Towers, that are responsible for keeping Lane Creeps as powerful as their counterparts. There are two Barracks for each lane per faction - one for Melee Creeps, and one for Ranged Creeps. Destroying either Barracks provides a large boost to the destroying team's associated Lane Creeps, increasing their statistics, as well as reducing the gold and experience they give when killed. </p>

                <p>Ancients are massive structures found inside each faction's base. In order to win, each team must destroy the enemy team's Ancient. Ancients have no offensive abilities themselves, but are guarded by 2 Towers. They cannot be attacked until both Towers are destroyed.

Ancients have 4250 hit points, and regenerate 3 hit points/second. Ancients also have 15 armor, 1800/1800 sight range, and True Sight in a 900 area around them.</p>
